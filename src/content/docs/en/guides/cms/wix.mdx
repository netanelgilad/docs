[Wix](https://wix.com) is a visual website builder with a headless CMS and business solutions APIs, that can be used to provide content and 
power your Astro project.

## Integrating with Astro

The Wix integration for Astro allows you to build custom frontends with Astro on top of the Wix Developer Platform. The integration 
provides a boilerplate-free development experience with a set of tools to help streamline your development with Wix.

The main features of the Wix integration for Astro include:

- **Easy SDK Integration**: Use the Wix SDK modules directly through a pre-initialized and contextually available `WixClient`.
- **Session Management Middleware**: A middleware that manages a session cookie for the current site visitor.
- **Adapter for Wix Hosting**: The integration provides an adapter for Wix hosting, allowing you to deploy your Astro project to Wix hosting.

### Prerequisites

To get started with the Wix integration for Astro, you will need to have the following:

1. **An Astro project** - If you don't have an Astro project yet, our [Installation guide](/en/install-and-setup/) will get you up and running in no time. 
:::note[Choosing a template]
Wix offers a collection of Astro templates that are pre-configured with the Wix integration for Astro and act as a starting point for different types of projects. 
Check out our Wix Astro templates on GitHub: [wix/headless-templates/astro](https://github.com/wix/headless-templates/tree/main/astro).
:::
2. **A Wix Account and a Wix Site / Business** - If you don't have a Wix account yet, you can sign up 
for an account and create your first project with [Wix Headless](https://www.wix.com/studio/developers/headless).
3. **A Wix Client ID** - You will need a Wix Client ID to authenticate your Astro project with Wix APIs. To create 
a new OAuth App and obtain a Wix Client ID, check out our documentation on 
[Create an OAuth App](https://dev.wix.com/docs/go-headless/getting-started/setup/authentication/create-an-oauth-app-for-visitors-and-members).

### Setting up credentials

:::tip
If you are deploying your project to Wix, check out the guide on [Environment Variables with the Wix Custom Frontends CLI](../cli//local-development.md).
:::

The Wix integration requires the `WIX_CLIENT_ID` environment variable to be set. For local development, you can create a 
`.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the `WIX_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.

```ini title=".env.local"
WIX_CLIENT_ID=your-wix-client-id
```

### Add the Wix Integration to an Existing Astro Project

If you already have an Astro project or didn't start from a pre-configured Wix template, you can add the Wix integration to an existing Astro project.

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npx astro add @wix/astro
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm astro add @wix/astro
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn astro add @wix/astro
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

This will install the Wix integration for Astro and add add the necessary configuration to your project.

:::note[Deploying to Wix]
The Wix integration also provides an adapter for hosting on Wix Custom Frontends. If you are deploying your Astro project to Wix,
be sure to change your `astro.config.ts` so that the integration is used as an adapter. See more at [Deploying to Wix](#deploying-to-wix).

```ts title="astro.config.mjs"
import wix from "@wix/astro";

export default {
  // ...
  adapter: wix(),
};
```
:::

### Installing the Wix SDK Modules

To work with the Wix APIs in your Astro project, the Wix Integration provides a pre-initialized and contextually 
available `WixClient` that allows you to use the Wix SDK modules directly in your Astro project. To use the SDK modules,
just install the relevant npm package and import the modules in your Astro components.

For example, for an online store project, you'll need to install the `@wix/stores` and `@wix/ecom` npm packages.

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npm install @wix/stores @wix/ecom
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm add @wix/stores @wix/ecom
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn add @wix/stores @wix/ecom
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

:::tip
To get started with the Wix SDK modules and learn about all the available modules, check out the [Wix SDK documentation](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk).
:::

### SDK Modules in Astro Components frontmatter

You can use any of the SDK modules in your Astro components frontmatter to fetch data at build time or on-demand. There's no need to create an explicit `WixClient` and methods can be called directly.

```astro
---
import { products } from "@wix/stores";

const storeProducts = await products.queryProducts().find();
---

<h1>Products</h1>

{storeProducts.map((product) => (
  <div>
    <h2>{product.name}</h2>
    <p>{product.description}</p>
  </div>
))}
```

#### Pre-rendering

When used in pre-rendered components or pages, the SDK modules will use an automatically generated visitor session for the entire build. 
This means you'll only be able to access public data, and any data that requires a visitor session will be reset on each build.

> ðŸ’¡ If you are working with APIs that require a **current visitor session** (like the ecommerce current cart APIs), be sure to set 
the relevant pages / components to [on-demand rendering](#on-demand-rendering).

##### On-demand rendering

When used in on-demand rendered components or pages, the SDK modules will use the current visitor session. This means you'll be able to 
access data that requires a visitor session, and the data will be fetched on-demand when the page is visited.

Visitor session management is handled by the [Session Management Middleware](#session-management-middleware).

### SDK Modules in Scripts / UI Frameworks

You can also use the SDK modules in your scripts or UI frameworks. Just import the modules and use them as you would in any other JavaScript environment.

```html
<p>Products in store: <span id="productsCount">...</span></p>
<script>
import { products } from "@wix/stores";

const storeProducts = await products.queryProducts().find();

document.getElementById("productsCount").innerText = storeProducts.items.length;
</script>
```

In your scripts or UI framework components, your API calls will be authenticated with the current visitor session as managed by the 
[Session Management Middleware](#session-management-middleware).

### Deploying to Wix Custom Frontends

The Wix integration provides an adapter for Wix hosting, allowing you to deploy your Astro project to Wix Custom Frontends. 
With Wix Custom Frontends, you get a serverless hosting solution that can power any Astro project, both with static output, 
server output and mixed output. This allows you to build static and dynamic sites with Astro and deploy them to Wix.

To deploy your Astro project to Wix Custom Frontends, you'll need to set up the Wix integration as an adapter in your `astro.config.ts`.

```ts title="astro.config.mjs"
import wix from "@wix/astro";

export default {
  // ...
  adapter: wix(),
};
```

To deploy your project to Wix, you'll use the [Wix Custom Frontends CLI](../cli/deploying-to-wix.md) to upload your build output to Wix.
First, install the Wix Custom Frontends CLI:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npm install --dev @wix/cli-edge
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm add --dev @wix/cli-edge
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn add --dev @wix/cli-edge
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Then, build your Astro project and deploy it to Wix:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npx astro build
  npx wix edge deploy --prod
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm build
  pnpm wix edge deploy --prod
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn build
  yarn wix edge deploy --prod
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Your Astro project will be deployed to Wix Custom Frontends and will be available at the URL of your Wix site.
